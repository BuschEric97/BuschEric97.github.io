      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Eric Busch! I am studying computer science at The University of Texas at Dallas.
        I know many programming languages such as C/C++, Java, C#, and Python among others.
        I am constantly looking to learn more and to expand my knowledge.<br><br> Beyond computer
        science my hobbies include making origami, playing video games, and watching anime. I am
        currently studying Japanese as a second language and I hope to become fluent before too long.
        <br><br> I hope you enjoy my website and thank you for visiting!</p>
