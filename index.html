      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="./ProfilePic_HairDown.jpg" width="25%" height="25%" />
      <p>Hi, I'm Eric Busch! I am studying computer science at The University of Texas at Dallas.
        I know many programming languages such as C/C++, Java, C#, and Python among others.
        I am constantly looking to learn more and to expand my knowledge.<br><br> Beyond computer
        science my hobbies include making origami, playing video games, and watching anime. I am
        currently studying Japanese as a second language and I hope to become fluent before too long.
        <br><br> I hope you enjoy my website and thank you for visiting!</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Password Generator App</h3>
          <p>Spring 2019</p>
          <p>I used the cross-platform framwork "Flutter" to create a mobile app that generates
            passwords given user specified parameters. The password generation is based off of
            this <a href="https://youtu.be/Pe_3cFuSw1E" target="_blank">video</a> by Numberphile
            on YouTube.</p>
          <a href="https://github.com/BuschEric97/password_generator" target="_blank">Project Repository</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Closed Files Determiner</h3>
          <p>Fall 2019</p>
          <p>I used Windows Form App development in C# to create a program to use data from Excel
            spreadsheets to determine which files closed with Home Abstract & Title Company and
            which files did not. This program was an independent effort to help improve the speed
            and quality of performance reports used by the CEO of Home Abstract & Title Company.</P>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Location Based Social Media Website</h3>
          <p>Spring 2019</p>
          <p>I collaborated with a team to create a new social media website that pins threads to
            locations much like leaving a physical note somewhere. I worked on the backend development
            of the website while others worked on the frontend.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Reversi in MIPS Assembly</h3>
          <p>Fall 2017</p>
          <p>I collaborated with a team to program the game Reversi in MIPS assembly language. I acted as
            the project lead and also wrote a significant portion of the code.</p>
