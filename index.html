          <p>Hi, I'm Eric Busch! I am studying computer science at The University of Texas at Dallas.
            I know many programming languages such as C/C++, Java, C#, and Python among others.
            I am constantly looking to learn more and to expand my knowledge.<br><br> Beyond computer
            science my hobbies include making origami, playing video games, and watching anime. I am
            currently studying Japanese as a second language and I hope to become fluent before too long.
            <br><br> I hope you enjoy my website and thank you for visiting!</p>

              <h3>Closed Files Determiner</h3>
              <p>Fall 2019</p>
              <p>I used Windows Form App development in C# to create a program to use data from Excel
                spreadsheets to determine which files closed with Home Abstract & Title Company and
                which files did not. This program was an independent effort to help improve the speed
                and quality of performance reports used by the CEO of Home Abstract & Title Company.</P>

              <h3>Password Generator App</h3>
              <p>Spring 2019</p>
              <p>I used the cross-platform framwork "Flutter" to create a mobile app that generates
                passwords given user specified parameters. The password generation is based off of
                this <a href="https://youtu.be/Pe_3cFuSw1E" target="_blank">video</a> by Numberphile
                on YouTube.</p>

              <p>I am using this website as a tool to learn HTML/CSS and other frontend web development
                languages and frameworks. Additionally, this website serves as a companion to my resume.</p>

              <h3>Location Based Social Media Website</h3>
              <p>Spring 2019</p>
              <p>I collaborated with a team to create a new social media website that pins threads to
                locations much like leaving a physical note somewhere. I worked on the backend development
                of the website while others worked on the frontend.</p>

                the project lead and also wrote a significant portion of the code.</p>
